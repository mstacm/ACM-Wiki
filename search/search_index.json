ACM stands for Association for Computing Machinery we are a chapter of the larger ACM organization which you can check out on their website here . So we are the Missouri S&T ACM chapter. That's why you see in a lot of our branding, username, and even our website domain we got by mstacm which means Missouri (m) S&T (st) ACM (acm). So if you see that around online it is probably us! What Do We Do? I always like to say that ACM is the \"unofficial coding club on campus\" because most people get what that kind of entails, however ACM is much more than that. ACM's purpose is to promote learning and innovation in the field of Computer Science. So really anything and every computers is what we focus on. Now there is a lot to focus on when it comes to Computers so that is why we have SIGs or Special Interest Group(s)! These are the communities that reside in ACM that focus on more specific areas of computing and allow for ACM to have such a broad range of topics for students to be involved in. Now this begs the question if ACM has SIGs then how does the structure work? ACM Structure ACM is made up of two parts ACM General and it's SIG's (i.e. ACM Web, ACM Hack, etc.) ACM General ACM General is like the umbrella that all of the SIGs sit underneath. ACM General is made up of the Executive Board and SIG Chairs (you can learn more about those here ). ACM General is responsible for all BIG ACM events this would be our semester events like MinerLAN, the Career Fair Dinner, and more. Along with this we have big events like our yearly MegaMiner or helping to renovate the 2nd floor CS lounge. The Executive board that makes up ACM General is in charge of finding the funding for ACM (either through sponsors or the school), running our weekly Officer Meetings and monthly General Meetings, and just basic general odds and ends of ACM. ACM General also works very closely with the CS Department and the school in general to make sure that students are giving the best experiences when they are apart of ACM. SIGs All SIGs sit underneath ACM General, and their leaders are chairs on the ACM General Executive Board.
