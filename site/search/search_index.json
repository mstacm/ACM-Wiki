Contribute ideas and thoughts, as well as maintain order. Make sure all comments are heard and that no one\u2019s comments are suppressed by other members of the board. Be familiar with the constitution and follow it as strictly as possible. This will ensure that no one is treated unfairly and poor decisions are less often to occur.

ACM General has focused using Notion over Google Drive in recent years due to it's better feature set for our needs. Notion can be used for personal use, which I recommend trying as Notion has a bit of a learning curve (in my opinion) if you have never used software like it before. Once you get the hang of Notion it becomes much easier to use, please refer the \"Notion Tutorials\" for some links on this subject. Benefits of Notion Notion has some really cool features that are vary valuable to ACM that I would encourage future Officers and Chairs to look into. #1: You can publish live sites from a Notion page. This is an incredibly cool tool. Basically if your SIG, event, or any other ACM subsidiary needs a website they can create a simple Notion document that can then be served on the web for free. Note: please reach the ACM Web Master or Executive Board about getting a custom subdomain that routes to your site because the default Notion website URLs are not that clean. #2: LOTS of tools. Notion has a lot of tools, and I mean a lot. This makes it really great for creating organizational databases, documents, to-do's. Basically Notion can do a lot and that a big reason to use it over Google Drive which is it's flexibility I strongly encourage all ACM SIGs to use Notion to their full advantage. #3: It's all online. With Notion everything works in the browser so it works on any OS (there are even mobile apps). Since Notion is all ACM and independent of any University resources you can add anyone to the Notion regardless if they use their school email so collaboration is made easy. Notion Tutorials Official Notion Guides \"The Only Notion Tutorial you'll ever need\" - Rad Reads \"How to use Notion - Beginner Tutorial\" - YouTube Tutorial Who is allowed to use Notion? Any ACM Officer or Chair is allowed to have access to Notion in order to create or view information for ACM General or their respective SIG. However you may request access to use Notion if your SIG Chair or an ACM Officer deems it necessary. The best way to reach out for access if through the ACM Discord to anyone with an \"Officer\" tag or send by sending an email to acm@mst.edu. The Big Question: Why have this Wiki if Notion is so great? Great question I am so glad you asked! Basically this Wiki is meant for anyone in ACM to contribute and add to, unlike the Notion. The Notion is really meant for ACM Officer and Chairs so that ACM Executive specific (i.e. private) information is kept off the public web. But that causes a problem ... what if you are an ACM member who is looking to be apart of leadership and want to learn more about ACM? This is what that is for! This Wiki is meant to allow all people interest in ACM or currently involved in ACM to learn more about it as well as being a knowledge source for people to contribute to. This also helps to de-bloat the ACM Notion because a lot of information that could be publicly known sits stuffed in Notion. So it's basically a win-win! Google Drive What's Inside? The ACM Google drive contains all forms and (mostly archived) documents for ACM General. ACM has mostly moved away from the Google Drive and uses Notion for it's better team management tools and better note taking aspects. The Google Drive is still in use for things such as Google Forms and as an archive for all older ACM Materials there where documented and/or stored in side of the Google Drive. If you need something from the Google drive and are not an Officer or Chair please reach out to the ACM Logistics Officer who is in charge of maintaining those records. Who is allowed to use the Google? Any ACM Officer or Chair is allowed to have access to Notion in order to create or view information for ACM General or their respective SIG. However you may request access to use Notion if your SIG Chair or an ACM Officer deems it necessary. The best way to reach out for access if through the ACM Discord to anyone with an \"Officer\" tag or send by sending an email to acm@mst.edu. Figma What is Figma? Figma is a online collaborative design tool used by ACM to create flyers, logo designs, and various branding materials. The tool is similar to Adobe XD, InVision, and other UX/UI design programs. Why does ACM use Figma? ACM uses Figma because it allows for easy access and collaboration on design files. Figma provides a very friend UI with many tools to help create designs. If you are interested in working in Figma please checkout these tutorials as resources. Figma Tutorials Figma Masterclass for Beginners (2023 Updated) - YouTube Tutorial Official Figma Learn Tutorials ACM Figma Layout ACM has two main \"folders\" or workspaces inside Figma: ACM Branding and Flyers .
